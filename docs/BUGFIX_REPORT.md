# Bug Fix Report - Runtime Error and Camera Control Issues

## Date: 2025-08-25

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Runtime TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'alpha')

**Problem**: 
- WebGL context was being accessed before it was fully initialized
- The 'alpha' property was being read from a null WebGL context object

**Solution**:
- Added `onCreated` callback to Canvas component to safely initialize WebGL context
- Added error handling with try-catch block
- Added `onError` callback for Canvas error handling
- Added `preserveDrawingBuffer: false` to gl configuration
- Added state management for canvas readiness

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/GlitchArtCanvas.tsx`

### 2. Automatic Camera Zoom Control Issue

**Problem**: 
- Camera position was being directly manipulated in the `useFrame` callback within `CreepyGlitchMesh.tsx`
- This interfered with user's OrbitControls, causing unwanted camera movements during glitch effects
- AutoRotate was randomly enabled/disabled, creating unpredictable behavior

**Solution**:
- Removed direct camera position manipulation from `CreepyGlitchMesh.tsx`
- Set `autoRotate={false}` in OrbitControls
- Standardized control speeds (removed random variations)
- Added damping for smoother user control
- Maintained camera shake effects only as visual positioning (not direct manipulation)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/GlitchArtCanvas.tsx`
- `src/components/CreepyGlitchMesh.tsx`

## Technical Changes

### GlitchArtCanvas.tsx
```tsx
// Added canvas readiness state
const [canvasReady, setCanvasReady] = useState(false);

// Enhanced onCreated callback with error handling
onCreated={(state) => {
  try {
    if (state.gl && state.gl.domElement) {
      state.gl.setClearColor('#050505', 1);
      state.gl.shadowMap.enabled = true;
      state.gl.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap;
      setCanvasReady(true);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('WebGL context setup failed:', error);
    setCanvasReady(true);
  }
}}

// Improved OrbitControls
<OrbitControls
  enablePan={true}
  enableZoom={true}
  enableRotate={true}
  autoRotate={false}  // User control only
  maxDistance={50}
  minDistance={0.1}
  panSpeed={1.0}      // Consistent speed
  rotateSpeed={1.0}   // Consistent speed
  zoomSpeed={1.0}     // Consistent speed
  dampingFactor={0.1}
  enableDamping={true}
/>
```

### CreepyGlitchMesh.tsx
```tsx
// Removed camera manipulation
// BEFORE:
if (glitchTrigger) {
  state.camera.position.x += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1;
  state.camera.position.y += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1;
}

// AFTER:
// 카메라 직접 조작 제거 - 사용자 제어만 허용
```

## Testing Results

- ✅ Application starts without runtime errors
- ✅ WebGL context initializes properly
- ✅ Camera controls are now user-only
- ✅ Glitch effects still work visually without interfering with camera
- ✅ Performance maintained across all levels (low/medium/high)

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Stable Camera Control**: Users can now zoom and pan without unwanted automatic camera movements
2. **Predictable Behavior**: Camera shake effects are now subtle and don't interfere with user interaction
3. **Error Resilience**: Application gracefully handles WebGL initialization failures
4. **Consistent Performance**: Removed random performance variations that could cause stuttering

## Notes

- Camera shake effects are still present but only affect the initial camera position, not user controls
- All visual glitch effects (mesh distortion, color changes, particle effects) remain intact
- Performance optimizations for mobile and low-end devices are preserved
- Error logging added for debugging future issues
